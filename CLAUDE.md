# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Japanese research repository focused on AI geopolitics (AI地政学), tracking rapid developments in the AI industry. The repository is organized into specialized domains:

- **chips/**: AI semiconductor companies and technologies
- **autonomous/**: Autonomous vehicle technologies
- **robots/**: Humanoid robotics developments
- **glasses/**: AR/VR and smart glasses technologies
- **presentation/**: Related presentation materials

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-only repository with no executable code. The main content consists of:

- Markdown files with research and analysis (Japanese and English)
- Each directory contains detailed README.md files with comprehensive industry analysis
- Individual company/technology reports in specialized markdown files

## Content Architecture

### Primary Documentation Pattern
- Each domain directory contains a comprehensive README.md with industry overview
- Individual technology/company analyses are in separate .md files within each domain
- All documentation is bilingual (Japanese/English) with Japanese as primary language

### Key Content Areas

**AI Chips (chips/)**
- Comprehensive analysis of 20+ AI chip companies
- Companies covered: Ambiq, Groq, Cerebras, SambaNova, Tenstorrent, Graphcore, etc.
- Technical specifications, financial data, and market positioning
- Individual deep-dive reports (cerebras.md, groq.md, mncore.md)

**Autonomous Vehicles (autonomous/)**
- Focus on Level 4+ autonomous driving technologies
- Includes tensor_report.md analyzing Tensor's autonomous systems

**Humanoid Robotics (robots/)**
- Analysis of major humanoid robot companies and products
- Tesla Optimus, Boston Dynamics Atlas, Figure 02, 1X NEO Beta, etc.
- Technical specifications and development progress

## Working with This Repository

### Content Updates
- When updating company information, maintain the established format in README.md files
- Include technical specifications, financial data, and recent developments
- Preserve bilingual structure with Japanese as primary language

### Adding New Companies/Technologies
- Add new entries to the appropriate domain's README.md
- Follow existing format: company overview, technical specs, financials, market position
- Create separate .md files for detailed analysis if warranted

### File Organization
- Keep the flat directory structure within each domain
- Use descriptive filenames for specific technology reports
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting across all files

## Repository Context

This repository serves as a knowledge base for tracking the competitive landscape and technological developments in key AI domains. The focus is on providing comprehensive, up-to-date analysis of companies, technologies, and market dynamics that shape AI geopolitics.

No build commands, testing, or development tools are applicable as this is a pure documentation repository.
